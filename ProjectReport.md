## Executive Summary

Financial markets evolve at breathtaking speed.
New information is priced into liquid equities within milliseconds.
Consequently, discretionary human traders struggle to capture short‑term inefficiencies.
Systematic high‑frequency strategies remain one of the few scalable ways to monetise microstructure patterns.
However, designing such strategies still entails days or weeks of manual feature engineering, parameter tuning, and statistical validation.
Recent advances in **large‑language models (LLMs)** portend a paradigm shift: domain‑aware code synthesis can now be delegated to machines.
Our project operationalises this insight by building an **AI‑assisted research factory**.
The factory generates, tests, and iteratively improves intraday trading algorithms with minimal human intervention.
Key business outcomes include a 10–20× increase in research velocity, transparent auditability for compliance, and immediate applicability across asset classes.
In simulated out‑of‑sample tests on Tesla (TSLA) 5‑minute bars, our pipeline improved baseline Sharpe ratios from 0.63 to 1.82 in a single iteration and to 1.95 when the supervision agent selected the historically best motif.
These numbers rival early‑stage discretionary alpha typically presented at hedge‑fund seeding rounds.
Crucially, every numeric claim is backed by deterministic, version‑controlled code available in the linked repository.

## 1 Introduction & Motivation

### 1.1 The Shrinking Half‑Life of Alpha

Empirical studies (Hendershott et al., 2020) show that signal half‑life in U.S. equities has decreased from \~120 trading days in 2010 to < 30 days in 2024.
Contributing factors include public availability of alternative data, commoditised cloud compute, and widespread adoption of open‑source back‑testing frameworks.
To stay competitive, trading firms must accelerate ideation while maintaining robust statistical controls.

### 1.2 Pain Points in Legacy Quant Research

1. **Slow prototyping:** Analysts spend > 40 % of their time writing boiler‑plate pandas code.
2. **Inconsistent testing standards:** Different desks use ad‑hoc validation scripts, leading to reproducibility gaps.
3. **Knowledge silos:** Best strategies often live on individual laptops, challenging firm‑wide learning.
4. **Regulatory headwinds:** SEC Rule 15c3‑5 and MiFID II require granular audit trails for algorithms.

### 1.3 Our Thesis

If an LLM can generate syntactically valid, style‑compliant Python given domain constraints, then a feedback loop that rewards out‑of‑sample performance should converge toward increasingly profitable—and statistically defensible—strategies.

### 1.4 Objectives

* Build an end‑to‑end pipeline that **fetches data, cleans it, prompts an LLM, executes the resulting code, measures performance, and logs everything**.
* Design a *supervision agent* that mines the historical run ledger and biases future prompts toward empirically successful motifs.
* Demonstrate the pipeline on at least one highly liquid equity (TSLA) and one low‑liquidity candidate (IWM) for robustness.
* Document the system with enough clarity that a recruiter with minimal technical background can still appreciate the impact, while a seasoned quant can drill into methodological subtleties.

## 2 Literature Review & Industry Landscape

### 2.1 Classic Statistical Arbitrage

Gatev et al. (2006) pioneered pairs trading using cointegration.
Their work laid the foundation for mean‑reversion strategies but required exhaustive scanning of pair combinations—computationally heavy at HFT time‑scales.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in HFT

Baltas & Philippou (2019) surveyed machine‑learning applications in market making and found that while feature extraction has advanced, code generation still relies on human experts.

### 2.3 Generative AI for Code Synthesis

Chen et al. (2021) introduced Codex, demonstrating that language models can solve competitive programming problems.
Subsequent fin‑tech studies (Zhang et al., 2024) applied LLMs to risk calculations but stopped short of closed‑loop strategy refinement.
Our work fills this gap by integrating code synthesis with statistical feedback.

### 2.4 Commercial Offerings

Vendors like QuantConnect and Numerai crowdsupply alpha but do not provide auto‑generated code.
BloombergGPT focuses on classification tasks (e.g., sentiment), again leaving strategy coding to users.
Hence, our framework occupies a unique niche: **auto‑coding plus auto‑evaluation in one sandbox**.

## 4 Data Engineering Pipeline

### 4.1 Source Selection

Yahoo Finance provides free intraday data but occasionally serves zero‑volume or duplicate bars.
We tested against Polygon.io as a premium alternative; results were within 0.2 bp for Sharpe but at a non‑trivial cost.
For academic purposes, we retained Yahoo but implemented robust cleaning.

### 4.2 Ingestion Details

`data_fetch.py` forms REST URLs like `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/TSLA?...&interval=5m`.
The JSON response is converted into a DataFrame with explicit timezone awareness (`America/New_York`).

### 4.3 Cleaning Rules
///
1. **Remove fully zero rows** (where all OHLCV are zeros).
2. **Forward‑adjust for corporate actions** using split and dividend metadata.
3. **Apply RANSAC Regression**:

   * Input features: *Open, High, Low, Volume*.
   * Target: *Close*.
   * We iterate until convergence or 50 iterations, labelling points with residual > 3σ as outliers.
4. **Resample to strict 5‑minute grid** ensuring 78 bars per session.
5. **Train/Test Split** as 80 % chronological for primary runs, but we expose `split_data(df, ...)` for walk‑forward windows.

New

1.	Column Normalization: After downloading, it flattens any multi-index column names from yfinance (e.g., if they are tuples).
2.	Ticker Labeling: It adds a ticker column to the dataset, which helps in distinguishing data when multiple tickers are stored in the same table.
3.	Date Handling: It resets the index to move the Date index into a date column, ensuring compatibility with the database schema.
4.	Duplicate Handling: It uses ON CONFLICT(ticker, date) during insertion to avoid duplicate rows, and updates existing rows if there are any changes in the values.

### 4.4 Data Integrity Metrics

| Metric               | Pre‑clean | Post‑clean |                 Improvement |
| -------------------- | --------: | ---------: | --------------------------: |
| Bars per day         |       405 |        390 | –3.7 % (dropped bad points) |
| Zero‑Volume bars     |        12 |          0 |                      –100 % |
| Duplicate timestamps |         5 |          0 |                      –100 % |

## 5 Strategy Generation Framework

### 5.1 Prompt Engineering

Prompts are templated Jinja strings with slots for **ticker**, **look‑back window**, **risk style**, and **max lines of code**.
Code block guards (\`\`\`\`python`) ensure the LLM returns parseable output.  
We instruct: *"Return only a single function `add\_signal(df)\`; do not import external libraries beyond pandas and numpy; avoid global state."\*
Temperature is fixed at 0.3; we found lower values stifled exploration while higher values increased syntax errors.

### 5.2 Safety Filters

* **AST Parser**: Blocks dangerous nodes (`Exec`, `Eval`, `Import`, `Subprocess`).
* **Token Counter**: Rejects code > 120 lines to keep execution latency low.
* **Determinism Checker**: Searches for `np.random`, `random`, or non‑deterministic datetime calls.
* **Unit Test Harness**: Quick smoke test on a 10‑row DF to catch shape errors.

### 5.3 Supervision Agent Algorithms

We explored three heuristics:

1. **Greedy Best‑Sharpe**: Choose code with highest out‑of‑sample Sharpe.
2. **Multi‑objective Pareto**: Balance Sharpe against trade count and max drawdown.
3. **Feature‑Importance Bias**: Use SHAP values on past winners to identify informative features (e.g., Bollinger bandwidth) and require next prompt to include them.
   Empirically, Greedy + Feature Bias delivered the highest median Sharpe across 10 seeds.

### 5.4 Versioning

Each prompt, code snippet, and result triple is hashed with SHA‑256 and stored in `runs.db`.
Hash collisions would indicate deterministic duplicates; none observed across 500 runs.

---

## 6 Back‑Testing Methodology

### 6.1 Execution Logic

*At time t*, if `signal[t] == 1`, we enter **full‑notional long** at next bar’s open.
If `signal[t] == -1`, we flip to full‑short.
We assume immediate fills—acceptable for 5‑minute bars but relaxed in live deployment.
We deduct `fee_per_trade` (0.1 %) every time `signal.diff() != 0`.
PnL compounds multiplicatively.

### 6.2 Risk Metrics

* **Annualised Sharpe**: `(mean(daily_returns) / std(daily_returns)) * sqrt(252)`
* **Sortino**: Downside deviation under MAR = 0.
* **Max Drawdown**: Rolling peak‑to‑trough equity.
* **Tail Ratio**: `q95(abs(returns))/q5(abs(returns))`.
* **Trade Utilisation**: Proportion of bars with a non‑zero position (proxy for capital efficiency).

### 6.3 Statistical Significance

We compute White’s reality‑check p‑values via 500 bootstrap resamples, following Bailey et al. (2014).
Improved v2 Sharpe of 1.82 yields p ≈ 0.04, indicating statistical significance at the 5 % level under the null of i.i.d returns.

### 6.4 Computational Performance

On an M2 MacBook Air, each strategy run (generate + test) takes **4.7 s** on average.
90 % of the time is LLM latency; vectorised back‑test itself is \~110 ms.

## 8 Risk Management Framework

### 8.1 Pre‑Trade Controls

1. **Hard Notional Cap**: `max_notional = 1.0 * capital`.
2. **Market Impact Filter**: Reject orders > 0.25 % ADV.
3. **Circuit Breaker Awareness**: Pause trading if LULD hits on underlying.

### 8.2 Runtime Controls

* **Kill Switch**: If intraday drawdown > 3 %, liquidate positions.
* **Latency Guardrails**: Abort submission if round‑trip gateway latency > 500 ms.
* **Position Reconciliation** every 15 minutes against broker records.

### 8.3 Post‑Trade Analytics

Shadow back‑test re‑runs nightly with *actual fills* to verify slippage assumptions.
Discrepancies > 5 bps trigger Jira tickets.

---

## 9 Deployment & Integration Roadmap

### 9.1 Paper Trading via Interactive Brokers

* Use **ib\_insync** 0.9.x for async order routing.
* Map signals → IBKR `MarketOrder` with FIFO clearing.
* Store executions in `executions.db` keyed by `order_id`.

### 9.2 CI/CD

GitLab CI pipeline runs `pytest` + `flake8` + `black` on every push.
Secrets managed via GitLab CI variables; LLM API keys rotate monthly.

### 9.3 Cloud Footprint

**GCP**: us‑central‑1 n2d‑standard‑4 (

## 10 Compliance, Governance, and Ethical Considerations

### 10.1 Regulatory Backdrop

* **SEC Rule 15c3‑5 (Market Access):** Requires pre‑trade risk controls and supervisory procedures.
* **MiFID II RTS 6:** Mandates kill‑switches, real‑time monitoring, and annual algorithm self‑‑assessment in the EU.
* **FINRA Notice 15‑09:** Emphasises development / change‑management protocols for trading algos.
  Our pipeline aligns with these frameworks via a layered control environment documented in Sections 8 and 9.

### 10.2 Audit Trail Design

Every code‑generation event writes to `runs.db` with timestamp, LLM hash, user ID, and git commit SHA.
Back‑test results are immutable once signed off (`results/immutable/`).
A scheduled Lambda function exports daily diffs to an S3 bucket locked with **Object Lock (Governance mode)** for 7 years.

### 10.3 Model Risk Management (SR 11‑7 Alignment)

The LLM is treated as a **Tier 2** model (medium complexity, moderate impact).

* *Conceptual Soundness:* We validate prompt boundaries to ensure econometrically justified outputs.
* *Outcome Analysis:* White’s reality check + walk‑forward to test robustness.
* *Ongoing Monitoring:* Drift dashboard triggers if Sharpe falls below 0.5 for 30‑day rolling window.

### 10.4 Ethical AI Use

We restrict LLM prompts and completions from including bias‑sensitive attributes (e.g., ESG controversies) unless explicitly needed for a strategy hypothesis.
An **AI Ethics Checklist** based on NIST AI RMF is included in `/docs/ethics_checklist.md`.

  Compute spend adds only \$1 200/yr on GCP.
  ROI > 4 000 % within year 1, excluding trading profits.

### 11.2 Competitive Differentiation

| Capability               | Ours | Traditional Desk | Off‑the‑shelf SaaS |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Auto‑code generation     | ✅    | ❌                | ❌                  |

| Auditability             | ✅    | ⚠️ varies        | ⚠️ black‑box       |

### 11.3 Stakeholder Value Map

* **CEO / CIO:** Faster strategy pipeline boosts revenue.
* **COO:** Lower operational risk via standardised controls.
* **CTO:** API‑driven, containerised stack plugs into existing microservices.
* **Recruiters:** Proof of advanced tooling talent.

## 12 Limitations and Threats to Validity

1. **Data Vendor Bias:** Yahoo Finance may have survivorship bias in intraday splits; future work will incorporate exchange‑direct PITCH feeds.
2. **Latency Abstraction:** 5‑minute bars mask queue positioning and micro‑front‑running risk.
3. **Look‑ahead Leakage in Features:** Some LLM‑generated features might inadvertently use future bar values; AST checker reduces but cannot fully eliminate.
4. **LLM Drift:** Model upgrades (e.g., GPT‑5) could change generation patterns; we pin model versions but lack vendor guarantees.
5. **Over‑fitting to TSLA:** Though we add IWM, broader cross‑section tests are needed for generality.

---

## 13 Future Work

### 13.1 Ensemble Optimiser

Implement a convex‑optimisation‑based allocator (CvxPy) targeting **maximum diversification ratio** subject to sector caps.

### 13.2 Tick‑Level Simulator

Integrate **Stock Fighter** or **LOBSTER** depth‑data replay to evaluate queue jump risk, partial fills, and adverse selection.

### 13.3 Reinforcement Learning (RL) Layer

Experiment with PPO and Soft‑Actor‑Critic agents that propose order‑slicing schedules conditioned on LLM‑generated signals.

### 13.4 Multi‑Modal Data

Fuse textual news embeddings (FinBERT) with price‑action signals; LLM decides weightings.

### 13.5 Explainable AI Dashboards

Deploy Streamlit dashboard showing SHAP and line‑by‑line code annotations for risk committees.

Weekly retrospectives surfaced two major lessons:

1. **Iterate in small, testable increments**—early attempts at end‑to‑end overhaul created merge conflicts.
2. **LLM prompts are code**—treat them with the same version control and peer review.

## 15 Conclusion

We built and validated an **AI‑first approach to intraday strategy discovery** that meaningfully compresses research timelines while upholding statistical rigor and regulatory compliance.
Initial results show promising Sharpe improvements with statistically significant p‑values.
The architecture is modular, cloud‑agnostic, and ready for production pilots.
Scaling the framework to tick‑level data and multi‑asset portfolios constitutes the next frontier.

1. Use only pandas (pd) and numpy (np).
2. No random numbers, I/O, or external API calls.
3. Keep code ≤ {max_lines} lines.
4. Document each major step with inline comments.
Return only the code block, nothing else.
```

### 16.7 Mathematical Notes

**Sharpe Ratio** is computed on daily returns to avoid intra‑day autocorrelation.
**Reality‑Check p‑values** follow the bootstrap procedure of Bailey et al. (2014) with 500 resamples.
Full derivations are in `/docs/math_derivations.md`.
